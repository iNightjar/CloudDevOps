### In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS by performing the following steps:

    1-You will create a public S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket.
    2-You will configure the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies.
    3-You will speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.
    4-You will access your website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.
